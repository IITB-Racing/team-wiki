# Overview
Here we need to explain breifly (focus on future plans):

- what stage of the algorithm development we are in and what we are trying to achieve (no need to explain basics)
- what we have done till now and major issues encountered
- what we are planning to do next

## What we did in 2022-23
Give details about previous year's algorithm, how we implemented it and the results we're able to get (do include any pictures/external links you want to share).

**TL;DR:**

(*Add a contents sections here, and link to the sections below.*)

#### Initial Plan 

#### What wasn't going well

#### How we tried to resolve it

#### Results
Explain how did we measure the results, and what were the results we got. Do share pirctures of them.

#### The good
Explain the good things/postive things about the algorithm and/or out implementation of it.

#### The bad
Explain any shortcomings/issues with the algorithm and/or our implementation of it.

#### Challenges faced
Explain any challenges we faced while implementing the algorithm.

#### What could be done next?
Explain what we could do next to improve the results, and how we may move further.


## Algorithms explored till now
List the algorithms/libraries we have explored till now, and give a breif description of each's implementation, the postives/negatives.
